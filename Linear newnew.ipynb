    "- **Ames Housing Dataset**  \n",
    "  - Contains **1460 houses × 81 columns**.  \n",
    "  - **Features (80 columns):** lot size, number of rooms, year built, etc.  \n",
    "  - **Target (1 column):** `SalePrice`, the house price we want to predict.  \n",
    "  - Often used as a benchmark in regression tutorials. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Suppress warnings**  \n",
    "  - `warnings.filterwarnings()` hides solver/runtime warnings that may appear (especially with high-degree polynomials), keeping the notebook output clean.  \n",

    "- We pick a few numeric columns that are likely related to house price (check the [explanation](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/regression-techniques-house-prices/data) of each feature):\n",
    "  - `GrLivArea` (living area in sqft)  \n",
    "  - `BedroomAbvGr` (bedrooms above ground)  \n",
    "  - `GarageCars` (garage capacity)  \n",
    "  - `FullBath` (full bathrooms)  \n",
    "  - `LotArea` (lot size in sqft)  \n",
    "  - `YearBuilt` (year the house was built)  \n",
    "  - `TotRmsAbvGrd` (total rooms above ground)  \n",
    "  - `Fireplaces` (number of fireplaces)  \n",
    "- **Target variable**:  \n",
    "  - We use `SalePrice`, scaled down by 1000 for readability (so prices are in thousands).  \n",
    "- **Scatter plots:**  \n",
    "    - `plt.scatter()` shows how each feature relates to the target.  \n",
    "    - A stronger linear trend (e.g., **GrLivArea vs SalePrice**) suggests that **linear regression** may fit well. \n",
    "- **Subplots setup:**  \n",
    "    - `plt.subplot(131)` creates the **first** plot in a row of 3.  \n",
    "    - `132`, `133` specify the **second** and **third** plots.  \n",
    "- **Other details:**  \n",
    "    - `alpha=0.6` makes points **semi-transparent**, so overlaps are easier to see.  \n",

    "\n",
    "💡 **Tips**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why multiple regression?**  \n",
    "  - Instead of using only one feature (like `GrLivArea`), we now include **several predictors** to improve accuracy.  \n",
    "  - Each feature contributes to predicting `SalePrice` while controlling for the others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature scaling**  \n",
    "  - `StandardScaler()` standardizes features so they have mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.  \n",
    "  - This is important when predictors are measured on very different scales (e.g., `GrLivArea` in square feet vs. `GarageCars` in counts).  \n",
    "  - Scaling makes training more stable and ensures that features are treated fairly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pipeline**  \n",
    "  - `make_pipeline()` chains preprocessing steps (scaling) and model training into one object.  \n",
    "  - This ensures scaling is always applied consistently during both training and testing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation**  \n",
    "  - `RMSE` (Root Mean Squared Error): measures average prediction error in the same units as the target (thousands of dollars here).  \n",
    "  - `R²`: proportion of variance in house prices explained by the model (closer to 1 = better).  \n",
    "  - Always check both **training** and **test** performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualization**  \n",
    "  - Plot **Predicted vs. Observed** prices for the test set.  \n",
    "  - The red dashed line represents perfect predictions (`y = x`).  \n",
    "  - A good model has points close to this line, showing accurate predictions.  \n"

    "      - Output: \\([1, x, x^2, x^3]\\)  \n",
    "    - Here we only use **GrLivArea** and expand it into polynomial terms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why polynomial regression?**  \n",
    "    - A simple linear model (straight line) may miss nonlinear patterns.  \n",
    "    - Polynomial regression allows the model to \"bend\" and capture curved relationships.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Overfitting risk:**  \n",
    "    - Training error **always decreases** as degree increases (the model fits the training data better).  \n",
    "    - Test error may start **increasing** at higher degrees → this is overfitting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualization strategy:**  \n",
    "    - 1. Plot polynomial fits for **degrees 1, 2, 5, and 10**.  \n",
    "       - Compare how the curve shape changes as degree increases.  \n",
    "    - 2. Plot **train vs. test error** across degrees (e.g., 1–13).  \n",
    "       - Use `plt.yscale(\"log\")` since MSE values can differ by orders of magnitude.  \n",
    "- 3. **Smooth grid for plotting**  \n",
    "     - Instead of plotting predictions only at training data points, create a **smooth grid** of values for the feature:  \n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       X_plot = np.linspace(X1.min(), X1.max(), 200).reshape(-1, 1)\n",
    "       ```  \n",
    "     - `np.linspace(..., 200)` generates **200 evenly spaced values** across the feature’s range.  \n",
    "     - This makes the prediction curve **smooth and continuous**, which is much clearer than plotting only at raw data points.  \n",
    "     \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Key points**  \n",
    "  - The penalty term $\\sum w_j^2$ is **quadratic** (a smooth parabola).  \n",

    "\n",
    "💡 **Tips**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why binary classification?**  \n",
    "  - The Covertype dataset has 7 classes, but logistic regression is easiest to understand in the **binary case**.  \n",
    "  - Here, we focus only on two classes (e.g., class 3 vs. class 6) to demonstrate the basics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature selection**  \n",
    "  - We use only **one feature**: `Elevation`.  \n",
    "  - This makes it simple to visualize and interpret how logistic regression separates two classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data splitting**  \n",
    "  - `train_test_split()` splits the data into training (70%) and test (30%) sets.  \n",
    "  - Training set → used to fit the model.  \n",
    "  - Test set → used to evaluate generalization performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model training**  \n",
    "  - `LogisticRegression(max_iter=2000, n_jobs=-1)`  \n",
    "    - Creates the logistic regression model.  \n",
    "    - `max_iter=2000`: allows more iterations so the solver converges reliably.  \n",
    "    - `n_jobs=-1`: uses all CPU cores for faster computation.  \n",
    "  - **Penalty behavior**:  \n",
    "    - By default, scikit-learn applies **L2 penalty** (Ridge-style regularization).  \n",
    "    - You can override with `penalty=\"none\"` for no regularization (pure logistic regression).  \n",
    "    - With certain solvers (`liblinear`, `saga`), you can also use:  \n",
    "      - `penalty=\"l1\"` → Lasso-style regularization.  \n",
    "      - `penalty=\"elasticnet\"` → mix of L1 and L2.  \n",
    "  - `.fit(X_train, y_train)`  \n",
    "    - Fits the model to the training data.  \n",
    "    - Learns the best parameters (weights for the feature and a bias term).  \n",
    "    - Unlike linear regression, logistic regression outputs **probabilities**, which are then thresholded (default 0.5) to assign class labels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation metrics**  \n",
    "  - `accuracy_score`: overall proportion of correctly classified samples.  \n",
    "  - `classification_report`: shows **precision, recall, and F1-score** for each class.  \n",
    "    - **Precision** = out of predicted positives, how many are correct.  \n",
    "    - **Recall** = out of actual positives, how many are detected.  \n",
    "    - **F1-score** = harmonic mean of precision and recall (balances both).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key takeaway**  \n",
    "  - Using just one feature, the model is very simple, but it clearly demonstrates how logistic regression works.  \n",
    "  - Later, we will extend to multiple features and multiclass classification for better performance.  \n"

    "\n",
    "- **Pipeline setup**  \n",
    "  - `PolynomialFeatures(degree=d)`: generates polynomial and interaction terms.  \n",

    "## 2.7 Extend to Three Classes  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Tips**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **From binary to multiclass**  \n",
    "  - Logistic regression naturally supports **multiclass classification**.  \n",
    "  - By setting `multi_class=\"multinomial\"`, the model uses the [**softmax function**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deep-learning/what-is-softmax-classifier/) to assign probabilities across all classes.  \n",
    "  - This is more appropriate than training multiple one-vs-rest models when classes are not just binary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset selection**  \n",
    "  - Instead of just two classes (e.g., 3 vs. 6), we now include **three classes** (3, 5, and 6).  \n",
    "  - This allows us to see how logistic regression handles more than two categories at once.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model setup**  \n",
    "  - `LogisticRegression(max_iter=2000, multi_class=\"multinomial\", solver=\"lbfgs\")`:  \n",
    "    - `multi_class=\"multinomial\"` → enables softmax-based multiclass classification.  \n",
    "    - `solver=\"lbfgs\"` → efficient optimization method that supports multinomial logistic regression.  \n",
    "    - `max_iter=2000` → ensures the model has enough iterations to converge.  \n",
    "    **By default**  \n",
    "        - `penalty=\"l2\"` → Ridge-style regularization.  \n",
    "        - `C=1.0` → inverse of regularization strength.  \n",
    "          - Smaller `C` = stronger penalty (more shrinkage).  \n",
    "          - Larger `C` = weaker penalty (closer to no regularization).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation metrics**  \n",
    "  - `accuracy_score`: overall proportion of correctly classified samples.  \n",
    "  - `classification_report`: provides **precision, recall, and F1-score** for each of the three classes.  \n",
    "  - These metrics help evaluate if the model is biased toward certain classes or performs evenly across them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key takeaway**  \n",
    "  - Logistic regression extends naturally to handle multiple classes.  \n",
    "  - By using the multinomial setting, the model can learn decision boundaries that separate all classes simultaneously.  \n",
    "  - Performance depends on how distinct the feature distributions are for each class.  \n"
